## The Project

Galatea generates personality configuration files for AI coding assistants. Name a character — fictional, historical, or original — and Galatea researches them, builds a personality profile, and produces ready-to-use config files for Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Codex, and Amp.

## Why It Exists

Every coding agent ships with the same flat, corporate tone. Galatea fixes that. Want Sherlock Holmes reviewing your code? A grumpy pirate captain pair-programming? A Victorian butler managing your git commits? Galatea makes it real — personality affects communication style only, never code quality.

## Technical Highlights

- Python/FastAPI backend with LLM-powered character research (Anthropic Claude + web search)
- Next.js frontend with interactive Three.js hero, step-by-step personality wizard
- Content moderation to prevent misuse
- Preset personality gallery with one-click downloads
- Deployed on Fly.io with auto-scaling
