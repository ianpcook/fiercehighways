## The Challenge

Insurance underwriting relies on extracting accurate information from complex, unstructured documents—applications, medical records, financial statements. Manual processing was slow and error-prone.

## The Approach

At Sixfold, I built and led the ML team that developed document understanding systems. We combined computer vision, NLP, and domain-specific rules to extract structured data from messy documents.

## Technical Highlights

- Designed multi-modal document understanding pipeline
- Fine-tuned transformer models for insurance-specific extraction
- Built confidence scoring system for human-in-the-loop review
- Implemented active learning to continuously improve models

## The Outcome

The system achieved 40% improvement in extraction accuracy, enabling faster underwriting decisions and better risk assessment.
