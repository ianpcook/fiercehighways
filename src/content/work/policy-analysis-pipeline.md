## The Challenge

Defense agencies needed to analyze vast amounts of procurement data, contracts, and policy documents to make informed decisions. Traditional analysis methods couldn't keep up with the volume.

## The Approach

At RAND and Govini, I developed quantitative analysis pipelines that could process and synthesize large policy datasets. The systems combined statistical analysis, natural language processing, and visualization to surface insights.

## Technical Highlights

- Built ETL pipelines for diverse government data sources
- Developed statistical models for trend analysis and forecasting
- Created interactive dashboards for policy analysts
- Implemented reproducible research workflows

## The Outcome

The tools enabled analysts to process data that would have taken weeks in just hours, supporting critical procurement and policy decisions.
