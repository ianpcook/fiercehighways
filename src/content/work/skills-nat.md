## The Project

Skills N'at is a marketplace for AI agent skills — reusable packages of instructions, scripts, and tools that give coding agents new capabilities. Think npm, but for agent behaviors.

## Why It Exists

The agent ecosystem is exploding but fragmented. Every agent platform (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI) has its own way of extending capabilities, and there's no central place to discover and share them. Skills N'at bridges that gap with a curated, searchable directory.

## Technical Highlights

- Built with a focus on discoverability and ease of installation
- Supports multiple agent platforms with a single skill format
- Pittsburgh-themed because why not — "n'at" means "and that" in Pittsburghese
